    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>REST API Development:</strong> Build a RESTful API using
        MuleSoft's Anypoint Platform. The API can be used to retrieve and update
        data from a database or external service.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Salesforce Integration:</strong> Integrate MuleSoft with
        Salesforce to exchange data between the two systems. You can build an
        API that connects to Salesforce and retrieves data from it, or a
        connector that allows MuleSoft to send data to Salesforce.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>File Transfer:</strong> Build a MuleSoft flow that transfers
        files between systems. You can use MuleSoft's File connector to read and
        write files, and build a flow that processes and transfers files between
        systems.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Message Processing:</strong> Build a MuleSoft flow that
        processes messages between systems. You can use MuleSoft's Message
        Processor component to transform messages, route messages to different
        systems, and perform other message processing tasks.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Payment Gateway Integration:</strong> Integrate MuleSoft with a
        payment gateway to enable online payment processing. You can build an
        API that accepts payment requests and sends them to the payment gateway,
        or a connector that allows MuleSoft to communicate with the payment
        gateway.
      </li>
